    <p>My favorite beverage is champurrado. It is a traditional Mexican drink made with 
    chocolate, masa, milk, and warm spices. It has a thick, smooth texture and a rich chocolate 
    flavor that feels very comforting. In my family, we usually drink champurrado on cold days 
    and during special occasions like "Día de Muertos" and "Christmas".</p>
